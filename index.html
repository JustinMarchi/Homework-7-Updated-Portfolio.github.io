                <p class="card-text">I'm a 33 year old father of one who has lived in four different states and wore different hats within numerous industries. Initially (and still) starting my career path in music, I worked in a small mom-and-pop music store where I managed and sold inventory as well as performing most instrument repairs. After going to school in Florida and gaining an Associates Degree in Audio Engineering and Recoring and a Bachelors Degree in Music Business, I moved to Los Angeles where I went from working as Production Assistant on commercial shoots, to mixing audio for TV and film trailers, before landing a job at Warner Music Group as they began their own experiment with producing artist merchandise in-house as opposed to being outsourced as it traditionally was. I spent 8 years at Warner Music Group, helping to grow the fledgling experiment to the point where we became the most profitable arm of the record label and we were welcomed into the fold as an official department of the company. After working with artists spanning every genre imaginable over years, I decided to move back east and continue to work from the NYC offices. After 2 years doing the horrible Metro North commute into the city, my son was born and I decided I wanted to find the flexibility in a job that allowed me to be closer to home. Since then I picked up skills as a barista at a local coffee shop in my old home town while I work towards my goal of a new career in web design and development. Who knows what the future holds, but I'm ready for whatever it may be!</p>
